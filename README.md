# Project-1
## This code project gathers and analyzes The raw purple air csv to finds public health risk hotspots. Also it shows how various factors including temperature and humidity affect air qualit. This project focuses on concentrations of PM2.5, PM10.0, and VOC. This data is displayed showing where and when these points of intrest occur

# Features
## -Uses custom logics to group enviromental factors on given categories
## -Uses aggreation to find the top 5 locations with highest mean and median concentrations
## -Uses a set filtering system to identify dates and times where concentration was unhealthy
## -Displays Data in an easy to read format with easy to understand conding structure

# Coding Resources used
## -Python
## -Pandas libary for tools and aggregation
## -Jupyter Notebook

# How to use
## -Make sure pandas and python is installed in the enviroment
## -Make sure the Raw CSV is in the same working directory as your notebook
